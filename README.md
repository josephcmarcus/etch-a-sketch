# etch-a-sketch

This project entailed creating a 16x16 grid that would mimic the behavior of an Etch-a-Sketch: When a user's mouse hovers over one box of the grid, that box should change to a darker background color to appear filled in. After completing the 16x16 grid version, I thought it would be fun to enhance the experience by making it appear like a functioning Etch-a-Sketch.
